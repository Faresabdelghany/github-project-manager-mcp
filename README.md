git clone https://github.com/Faresabdelghany/github-project-manager-mcp.git
cd github-project-manager-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. GitHub Token Setup

2. Generate a new token with these scopes:
   - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - `write:org` (Write organization data)
   - `read:org` (Read organization data)

### 3. Claude Desktop Configuration

Add this to your Claude Desktop MCP configuration file:

**Location**: 
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github-project-manager": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/github-project-manager-mcp/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-github-personal-access-token",
        "GITHUB_OWNER": "your-github-username",
        "GITHUB_REPO": "your-repository-name"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: Replace the following:
- `/path/to/github-project-manager-mcp/build/index.js` with the actual path to your built server
- `your-github-personal-access-token` with your GitHub token
- `your-github-username` with your GitHub username
- `your-repository-name` with the repository you want to manage

### 4. Restart Claude Desktop

After saving the configuration, restart Claude Desktop to load the MCP server.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable is required"**
   - Make sure you've added the GitHub token to your Claude Desktop config
   - Verify the token has the correct permissions

2. **"GITHUB_OWNER and GITHUB_REPO environment variables must be set"**
   - Add both GITHUB_OWNER and GITHUB_REPO to your environment variables
   - Make sure the repository exists and you have access to it

3. **"Failed to create issue: Bad credentials"**
   - Check that your GitHub token is valid and not expired
   - Verify the token has `repo` scope permissions

4. **Server not starting**
   - Run `npm run build` to compile TypeScript
   - Check that all dependencies are installed with `npm install`
   - Verify the path in Claude Desktop config is correct

### Testing the Server

You can test the server manually:

```bash
# Set environment variables
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-token"
export GITHUB_OWNER="your-username"  
export GITHUB_REPO="your-repo"

# Run the server
npm start
